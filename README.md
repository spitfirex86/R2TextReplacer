# R2TextReplacer

## Installation
1. Download [latest release](https://github.com/spitfirex86/R2TextReplacer/releases/latest)
2. Extract the ZIP to `Rayman 2\Mods\`
3. Enable mod loading in Ray2Fix

## Usage

### Dumping language tables
To dump builtin language tables, launch the game with the argument `-langdump`.\
This will generate .tbl files in `Rayman 2\Languages`.

### Loading custom languages
*Note: Run the game first to let the mod generate necessary config files.*

Place the language .tbl file in the `Rayman 2\Languages` directory.\
Then open `R2TextReplacer.ini` and type the name of the file (without extension) into the desired slot.

To revert back to the default language, leave the slot name empty.
